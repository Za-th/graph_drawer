Simple Graph Drawer written in Python with tkinter.

Left click to place a vertex, all vertexes will have a unique number.
Right click to select, selecting a vertex and then right clicking another will create an edge between them (two vertices can only have one edge between them).
Right clicking an edge will let you change the edge weight.
Middle click will delete vertices/edges.

Buttons:
Chromatic Number will colour the vertices with minimal colours
Chromatic Edge Number will colour the edges with minimal colours
MST will colour edges blue creating a minimum spanning tree in the graph, if possible.

There is currently a limit on 12 colours.
